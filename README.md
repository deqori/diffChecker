# diffChecker
A lightweight and simple diff checker. Unlike many online tools and app versions that may collect your data in accordance with their Privacy Policies and Terms of Use, this solution gives you full control.

## Installation

- Open the index.html file.
- That’s it — you’re ready to use it.

If you’re still unsure whether a server might collect your data, you can run it entirely offline:
- Run it, Right-click and select “View Page Source”, or
- Save the page to your computer (Ctrl + S / Cmd + S) and launch it locally.

Why use the offline version?
